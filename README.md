## üåü Philosophy: Setup Once, Enjoy Forever

Kyoo's philosophy revolves around simplicity. Set it up once, forget about configuration hassles. Once installed, your library undergoes automatic scanning, adding new episodes or movies as soon as they're moved into your library's folder. No need for a specific file structure or meticulously renamed files ‚Äì Kyoo does the right thing‚Ñ¢.

## üìú Why another media-browser?

From a technical standpoint, both Jellyfin and Plex lean on SQLite and confine everything within a single container, Kyoo takes a different route. We're not afraid to bring in additional containers when it makes sense ‚Äì whether for specialized features like Meilisearch powering our search system or for scalability, as seen with our transcoder.

Kyoo embraces the "setup once, forget about it" philosophy. Unlike Plex and Jellyfin, we don't burden you with manual file renaming or specific folder structures. Kyoo seamlessly works with files straight from your download directory, minimizing the maintenance headache for server admins.

Kyoo narrows its focus to movies, TV shows, and anime streaming. No music, ebooks, or games ‚Äì just pure cinematic delight.
